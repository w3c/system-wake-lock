System Wake Lock API
=============

On 9 Mar 2020, the Devices and Sensors Working Group [decided](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2020Mar/0001.html) to split the [Wake Lock API](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-wake-lock-20171214/) spec into two separate specs: [Screen Wake Lock API](https://w3c.github.io/screen-wake-lock/) and [System Wake Lock API](https://github.com/w3c/system-wake-lock).
